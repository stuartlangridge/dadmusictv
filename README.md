# Dad Music TV

Use a Raspberry Pi connected to a TV to play music, with that music stored on the SD card, the player controlled by Bluetooth from an Android phone, and no network at all required once it's running.

The server, which runs on the Pi, is in the `server/` folder; read its README for how to set it up.

The client, which runs on an Android phone, is in `client/` and has its own README.
