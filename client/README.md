# Dad Music TV

Use a Raspberry Pi connected to a TV to play music, with that music stored on the SD card, the player controlled by Bluetooth from an Android phone, and no network at all required once it's running.

Building for android

We get buildozer as per http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android.html:

mkdir buildozer
cd buildozer
# make a venv to install deps into
virtualenv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/kivy/buildozer.git
cd buildozer
python setup.py install

# install cython, v0.21 because the latest 0.22 at time of writing has a bug
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28674149/getting-error-mno-fused-madd-installing-kivy-in-virtualenv-over-fish-shell
pip install cython=0.21

# change to the client folder for our app
cd ..../client
buildozer android debug deploy run # builds, deploys to plugged in android device, runs app
# the apk is in bin/ in the client folder
